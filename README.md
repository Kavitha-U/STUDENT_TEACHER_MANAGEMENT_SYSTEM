User Authentication: Secure login for teachers and students with role-based access control.
Student Profile Management: Centralized management of student information, including personal details, academic performance, and attendance.
Teacher Management: Profile and task management for teachers, including class schedules, subjects, and grading responsibilities.
Course Management: Organize and assign courses to students, track assignments, and share resources.
Attendance Tracking: Teachers can record and view attendance for each class and generate attendance reports.
Gradebook and Performance Tracking: Teachers can input grades, and students can view their academic progress.
Communication Module: Built-in messaging system for communication between students and teachers.
Dashboard and Analytics: Provide insights into student performance, attendance trends, and more.
